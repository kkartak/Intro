# 3 Key takeaways of Markdown

## Markdown being written in Code format

I think the coolest thing about Markdown is the ability to write within inline code or create block code. Not only is it super simple to learn the basics, but it also allows people more versed in code to work fluidly with Markdown without getting stressed, without having to write blocks of code in different software, and without having to transfer them and make sure they flow seamlessly. Again, being able to write code in Markdown, as someone who is passionate about it, makes me happy. I can use it not only as an asset when job hunting, but also in my free time if I just want to play around with some simple Python-like code. I already figured out, well, messing around in Markdown, that if you hit the tab button twice, it will also create a block code! Which I'm happy for because that was how I often indented my lines of code previously, so the muscle memory was already there.

## What's challenging about Markdown

It's not so much a challenge as tedious, if anything, and it is having to line up a sublist to a current list by putting dashes or asterisks at the first character of the top list. It's a little detail I can see myself forgetting, and it will make me have to go back and fix the error in my work, slowing my workflow and probably annoying me a tad every time I catch myself forgetting.

## What's interesting about Markdown

The coolest thing I found out is that Google Docs supports Markdown and inline code. I never knew that Markdown was so widely used that it was even implemented in software as well-known as Google Docs. Additionally, I'm impressed that you can simply download or reformat a previously written document in Google Docs to Markdown if needed, while ensuring embedded links and images render correctly.
