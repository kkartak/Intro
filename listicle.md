# Intriguing tools I've learned about in my first week

For me the biggest benefit of learning something new, is whether or not it can be useful.
If the skills and knowledge I've acquired can be implemented into my day-to-day job, and if so how.

Here are three things tools that I found the most enjoyable and practical:

##  Writing with Markdown

The best part of writing within the space of Markdown is how minimalist it is to navigate.
It makes writing focus less on how it looks and feels and more on the actual core of an article, report, listicle ect.,
but instead on the message and information I'm trying to convey. It not only allows me to stay more goal oriented and practical
in what I'm writing, but let me appreciate how it's not about how an article looks, but the passion I have in writing it to begin with.
Markdown lets me do what I love doing which is writing; in addition it lets me use my computer science skills I learned once again in a practical way so I don't feel as if my other skills and talents are being wasted. 
It gives me a sense of accomplishment.

## The use of _underlines_ and *asterisks*

I find the use of these tools allows for my writing to be quicker and more precise because I don't have to think about what I want bolded or italicised I can simply add a keystroke before and after a letter, word, or phrase and the software will do the rest of it for me.
This tool is wonderful to me because I wasn't previously aware of it and the capabilities it provided for improving my typing speed.
Which will allow me to get projects, tasks, and work assignments down at a much quicker and more efficient rate.

## Using GitHub 

The use of GitHub was a wholly new concept to me. I never knew that code style writing was such a popular and widely used form for people within the technical writing field. When I first heard of the acronym HTML I figured it was a type of corporate typing style. I didn't know it was just a general term for the way in which someone writes their documents or other forms of articles in a way that allows others to collaborate on and track edits and suggestions made to files. It's nice to see that this style of writing isn't as complex and as scary as I had initially thought it to be. GitHub makes navigating its interface and software very straightforward and simple to understand. I had no trouble signing up and creating an account even though I had missed the initial class where creating accounts and learning the platform was held. The anxiety I felt from being behind vanished almost instantly once I logged in and created my repository; though this may be attributed to my computer skills and how comfortable I am with technologies similar to GitHub.

Overall the tools I've learned in the first week alone makes me feel much better equipped to join the technical writing workforce and not feel like I've lagged behind or I'm out of the loop of some inside joke only those in the profession would understand. It gives me a sense of confidence in my technical writing skill and adds another tool to my ever growing repertoire.
