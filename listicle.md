# Intriguing tools I've learned about in my first week

For me, the biggest benefit of learning something new is whether or not it can be useful.
If the skills and knowledge I've acquired can be implemented in my day-to-day job, and if so, how?

Here are three tools that I found the most enjoyable and practical:

##  Writing with Markdown

The best part of writing in Markdown is how minimalist it is to navigate.
It makes writing focus less on how it looks and feels and more on the actual core of an article, report, listicle ect,
but instead on the message and information I'm trying to convey. It not only allows me to stay more goal-oriented and practical
in what I'm writing, but let me appreciate how it's not about how an article looks, but the passion I have in writing it to begin with.
Markdown lets me do what I love doing, which is writing; in addition, it lets me use my computer science skills I learned once again in a practical way, so I don't feel as if my other skills and talents are being wasted. 
It gives me a sense of accomplishment.

## The use of _underlines_ and *asterisks*

I find the use of these tools allows for my writing to be quicker and more precise because I don't have to think about what I want bolded or italicised I can simply add a keystroke before and after a letter, word, or phrase and the software will do the rest of it for me.
This tool is wonderful to me because I wasn't previously aware of it and the capabilities it provides for improving my typing speed.
This will allow me to get projects, tasks, and assignments done much more quickly and efficiently.

## Using GitHub 

Using GitHub was a wholly new concept to me. I never knew that code-style writing was such a popular and widely used form in the technical writing field. When I first heard of the acronym HTML, I figured it was a type of corporate typing style. I didn't know it was just a general term for the way someone writes their documents or other articles, allowing others to collaborate on and track edits and suggestions to files. It's nice to see that this style of writing isn't as complex or scary as I initially thought. GitHub makes navigating its interface and software very straightforward and simple to understand. I had no trouble signing up and creating an account, even though I had missed the initial class where accounts were created and the platform was introduced. The anxiety I felt about being behind vanished almost instantly once I logged in and created my repository, though this may be attributed to my computer skills and my comfort with technologies like GitHub.

Overall, the tools I've learned in the first week alone make me feel much better equipped to join the technical writing workforce and not feel like I've lagged behind or I'm out of the loop of some inside joke only those in the profession would understand. It gives me confidence in my technical writing skills and adds another tool to my ever-growing repertoire.
